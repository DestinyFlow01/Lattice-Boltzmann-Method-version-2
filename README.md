# Lattice-Boltzmann-Method-version-2

These are the codes to develop the lattice boltzmann method, explained in the book written by Takaji Inamuro et al of 

"An Introduction to the Lattice Boltzmann Method : A Numerical Method for Complex Boundary and Moving Boundary Flow"

Two important scheme that will be developed in these codes are :
- Conventional Lattice Boltzmann Method 
- Improved LKS (Lattice Kinetic Scheme)

Both methods will be used to be able to simulate high Reynolds number case for 3D incompressible viscous fluid flow, considering  the equations of momentum equation for velocity distribution and energy equation for temperature distribution. The test cases  that will be used are the test cases for code validation and test cases in the book. Further improvements after the two main schemes will be developed later on. The improvements that will probably be included are LBFS (Lattice Boltzmann Flux Solver), ELBM (Entropic LBM),  SHSLBM (Simplified and Highly Stable Lattice Boltzmann Method), etc.

Up to this case, the LBM that will be developed is used for fluid simulation. Recently, LBM is developed to be able to simulate solid mechanics problems, such as the fracture mechanics, nonlinear elasticity, etc. This is my hope where LBM can be developed to simulate most continuum problem, such as fluid mechanics and solid mechanics problem.
